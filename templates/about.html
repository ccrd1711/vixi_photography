  <h1>About Vixi</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Tom, the photographer behind VIXI. I've studied photography for years and built up experience shooting 
    university sports, graduations, general events, and even portraits. I love capturing everything from fast-paced
    matches to the small details that make each event unique.</p>
  <p>It was the roar and spectacle of the Belgian Grand Prix that truly ignited my passion for sports photography
    and has convinced me to pursue it as a full-time career. Since then, I've focused on bringing that same energy and 
    attention to detail to every shoot I undertake.</p>
  <p>Despite my love for sports, I also still enjoy shooting portraits and events. I believe that every moment has 
    a story to tell, whether it's the thrill of competition or the joy of a special occasion. My goal is to capture those stories in a way 
    that resonates with people and preserves memories for years to come.</p>
  <p>So! If you're looking for sharp, authentic sports imagery for your upcoming event, or want to get in touch about 
    your next portrait session, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you and discuss how we can 
    work together to create something amazing.
  </p>
  <p>Below, you will find a link to a form where you can book me for your next event or portrait session. It does come
    with a small deposit to secure your date, but I promise it's worth it!
    Additionally, feel free to browse through my gallery to see some of my recent work and get a sense of my style.
